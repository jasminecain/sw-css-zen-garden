# sw-css-zen-garden

Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.

You will create your own version of the CSS Zen Garden.

Download the HTML and CSS files.
📎 HTML
📎 CSS

Copy the contents of the HTML file into your index.html.
Copy the contents of the CSS file into your styles.css.

The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.
When your work is complete, add, commit, and push up the branch (git push origin exercise). Then submit a pull request on Github.

✏️ In an effort to keep this project like the Zen Garden website, this exercise does not have a styles folder.
